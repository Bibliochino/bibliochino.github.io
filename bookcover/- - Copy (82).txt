Five Point Someone: What Not to Do at IIT (2004)
by Chetan Bhagat

1/5

Review : This is so ridiculous & disgusting.

It's all about how three IITians mess up everything and at last they regret & correct it.The story is so lame like there isn't any exciting moment.Indians are so much IIT obsessed that they'll like any piece of shit about it...

I've watched it's adaptation '3 Idiots' which is awesome & superb like among the best Bollywood movies..
Quite Funny huh!!!
