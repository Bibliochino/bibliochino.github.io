The Notebook (1996)
by Nicholas Sparks

5/5

Review:	“After dinner, I become afraid despite myself. I know I should be joyous, for this reunion is the proof that love can still be ours, but I know the bell has tolled this evening. The sun has long since set and the thief is about to come, and there is nothing I can do to stop it. So I stare at her and wait and live a lifetime in these last remaining moments.” 

It is a touching, poignant and compelling story that will forever linger in you with nostalgia. It resonates with an emotional vibrancy that will enchant one, making it remarkable and memorable. 

This is the best love story I've read so far. The beauty lies in the sweet little moments larger than life that they have spent together in a small south american village. The romance between Noah and Allie is Sublime!

Nicholas Sparks avoided much of Drama to make it a perfect Romance in the midst of nature. All the Love Letters and Poetry of Whitman, Tennyson, Thomas and Browning was described aesthetically.

I have a lot of feelings with this book which is difficult to express.
