The Canterville Ghost (1887)
by Oscar Wilde

4/5

Review:	“When a golden girl can win
Prayer from out the lips of sin,
When the barren almond bears,
And a little child gives away its tears,
Then shall all the house be still
And peace come to Canterville.” 

It was so sweet and funny. And Gosh, the writing style of Oscar Wilde nails every single time. The story was good and is actually a parody of Americans by an English. 

The American family is not at all afraid of the sinister Canterville Ghost and makes him so embarrassed and frightened every single time he attempts to scare them. The Ghost perceives the parents as too materialistic but they aren't as, in the end, they don't accept the priceless necklace and the twin boys are described so annoying but they care a lot for their sister. 

The funny thing was that the Ghost considered himself as the artist to the people who get scared (the admirers of his great work) and so he's totally ridiculed by the American family as of lacking brains to understand his art ... Lol!
