Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (1884)
by Edwin A. Abbott

2/5

Review:	A Flatter story of a Flatland 

I liked the concept but the story was quite boring, the scenes changed immediately and suddenly, i didn't quite enjoy the writing style...There was a lot discription of events & ethics of people of flatland which wasn't quite interesting, the events of Lineland & Spaceland were okay but it's just a forward going simple story. I didn't liked the female being so weak in Flatland & It's just a square story discribing his world & other worlds he meets out of curiosity...
