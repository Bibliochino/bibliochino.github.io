Siddhartha (1922)
by Hermann Hesse

5/5

Review:	First of all I really appreciate Hermann Hesse such a great poet & a magnificent Philosopher he dared & made a fascinating fiction of Buddhist mythology. I really enjoyed it's poetic style & would say it was the best of narration.

It is the essence of Buddhist philosophy of emptiness that knowledge can be shared but no wisdom it must be felt individually.Here Siddhartha (i.e. 'master of worldly senses' the meaning of the name) dejectes the act of learning as a disciple & moves forward alone in the search.He experiences all the worldly pleasure and then dejects them as the feelings of only momentarily pleasures & distancing one from the true happiness. The Truth, the wisdom lies itself in the very nature one has to feel it..Every mystery lies in our environment. And every being even things have a purpose & a roll to play. Everything is interlinked & can be understood by their relationships.

Siddhartha learned many things from many people in his life but made contradictions & then left it..that damage was an experience to him making him more wiser thus everything whether good or bad we say are the part of the cycle that runs the world...many things replace one another but they are most important in it & there isn't any other way..

The concept of time is contradicted..
And Nothing is Good Nothing is Bad, these are Relative...
