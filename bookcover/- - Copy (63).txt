A Walk to Remember (1999)
by Nicholas Sparks

5/5

Review: This book found a place in my heart, I won't forget it 

This was quite an experience to be felt. It's just a PERFECT piece.This was my 1st Nicholas Sparks' book & it's utterly awesome. It's so difficult to review this, I feel my review won't be giving as much justice as this deserves..

It's a simple love story between Landon(a quite normal boy) & Jamie(a highly religious girl) as two different types falls in love with each other..

There were many touching scenes that stucked in my heart.One was the meeting of Landon,Jamie,Eric & Margaret in Jamie's home..

I think when Landon asks Jamie before the climax was the most touching part that made my eyes wet.The divine bond between them was the essence of it.

It's an extraordinary book.. Touching as well as Revieting...I loved the writing style of Nicholas Sparks especially as how it described as the situation changed was quite mesmerising..

This was a marvellous part from the book-

"Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes."
