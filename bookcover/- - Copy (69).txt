Man's Search for Meaning (1946)
by Viktor E. Frankl

5/5

Review:	First of all Hats off to Dr. Viktor Frankl he has became an idol in my life..
The book is divided into two parts:
1) Experiences from the Camp
2) Logotherapy in a Nutshell

The first part is the personal experience in the concentration camp some events described brought tears in my eyes..
Suffering is an inevitable part of life which is a means to spiritual realisation.
But instead of surrendering one must find the meaning of his life & its purpose. A purpose can be found in any ones lives no matter how his conditions are..

The Philosophy & Psychology described in this book is an essence for everyone to inherit in himself.

The Logotherapy is a better form of psychotherapy. The best line to me was one must think that he is leading a second life and had done a wrong deed & has to correct it in this life..

It is a must read book & I highly recommend it.
