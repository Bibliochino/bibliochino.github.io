Fight Club (1996)
by Chuck Palahniuk

5/5

Review:	The first rule about fight club is you don't review it.
Sorry Chuck.
But, I'm Joe's Smirking Revenge! ;)
This nihilist transgressive fiction is pitiless and told brilliantly with dark humour. But as I've seen the movie before (It's my most favourite movie!), I find it somewhat disappointing as the movie was much better as the best scenes from the movie were quite different in the book. But still it's awesome.
Fight Club is about 'self-abnegation' (you are not the things you own), this is found in Hindu philosophy. 
“I say never be complete, I say stop being perfect, I say let’s evolve, let the chips fall where they may.” - perfection is the call of egoism and the reason behind it is that we are afraid of failure, risk, mediocrity even success! Perfection leads to development and evolution is quite different thing from it which is an essential parameter of creative living, Ignoring this all we get is foolish productivity.
"It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything.”
"It's your life and is ending one minute at a time."
I think this leaves a milestone in the history of manliness.
And Yeah,
His name is Robert Paulson! Lol!
