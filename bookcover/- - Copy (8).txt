The Prince (1513)
by Niccolò Machiavelli

4/5

Review:	Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli has dedicated this book to Lorenzo Di Piero De’ Medici the ruler of Florence at the Renaissance of Italy. This book is an intense case study of practical traits essential for a prince to control his reign from the history of diverse rulers in Italy including France, Spain and Ancient Rome.

However, the book is often criticised for it's separation of politics and ethics, Machiavelli argues that political action must always be considered in light of its practical consequences rather than some lofty ideal. 

But as Machiavelli clearly conceives the book as a means to expedite the successful unification of Italy, the vices like 'ruthlessness', 'deception' and 'manipulation' in perfect timings and limited quantities can work as a virtue for a ruler.
