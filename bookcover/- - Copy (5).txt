Love in the Time of Cholera (1985)
by Gabriel García Márquez

3/5

Review:	It's not that I didn't like the book much. The magical realism of Gabriel Garcia Marquez was marvelous, it's the plot - the story was too much melodramatic for me. I think Florentino had this folly obsession which I too have experienced and acted like him in my childhood, but now as an adult I'm sick of it, I believe it an OCD. Although I think Florentino is meant to be a victim of love as a disease like cholera in the times of epidemic itself. The book is undoubtedly romantic but there are parts which are quite difficult to digest for me.
After all, I totally adore the writing style and would be definitely reading his One Hundred Years of Solitude whose plot I believe would be rather fascinating :D
