The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (1922)
by F. Scott Fitzgerald

3/5

Review:	I was so curious to read this as the adaptation directed by David Fincher is one of my most favourite movies of all time ...
The book usually is written beautifully by F. Scott Fitzgerald is certainly missing the point, I mean it revolves around the social issues with Benjamin - born old and getting younger but it lacks the adventure and romance which is described in the movie, which is so necessary to provoke fascination and emotional connection with the central character in a curious case.
The movie starts with the rejection of Benjamin by his father and he is brought up by a black woman running a charitable institution, this mother-son relationship is described very beautifully in the movie and mainly the romance between Benjamin & Daisy is so notable.
Although ultimately it's a short story to put all these points but I think it could be made better.
