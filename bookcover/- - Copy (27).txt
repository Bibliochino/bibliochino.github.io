Of Mice and Men (1937)
by John Steinbeck

4/5

Review: “As happens sometimes, a moment settled and hovered and remained for much more than a moment. And sound stopped and movement stopped for much, much more than a moment.” 

A touching short story of two drifter farm boys - one being short but wise 'George' and the other being huge but fool 'Lennie' with their dreams of buying their own land working on a ranch ...
The story is very simple but there are quite notable features were the accents which were beautifully delivered, the diversity in characters (that's the best one) and the ending.

The title describes that Men like Mice are slaves of their destiny and are quite vulnerable to it. This allegory itself was symbolized at the starting parts of the story and the ending was made symmetric accordingly. 

I enjoyed the book especially the parts in ranch but before that, there were quite redundancies in dialogues which I feel should be avoided in a short story and to make something more fascinating.
