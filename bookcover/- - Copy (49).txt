A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (2013)
by George R.R. Martin

4/5

Review: 4.5 stars 
I am a big fan of GRRM, as well as everyone reading this review is ;)
I haven't read the Song of Ice n Fire books but have watched GoT and it's my most favourite show.
Now coming to this book, this wasn't as fascinating as SoInF, nor much tragic; but still It was so good. This book is actually the merged version of three novellas -
1)The Hedge Knight 2)The Sworn Sword and 3)The Mystery Knight, the best one I felt is the 3rd as there's a big plot twist in it (Spoiler! ehaa).
The reason I read this book instead of the novellas is ofcourse the beautiful Illustrations by Gary Gianni.
The story is centralised on Ser Duncan the Hedge Knight (future Kingsguard) and Aegon Targaryen (future King) and their adventures across the realm.
Aegon (the Egg) is actually 8 years old and the squire of Dunk in it, he is trained by Dunk to learn all the lessons of life in their journey as a boy.
Ser Duncan is brave and loyal, thick as a Castle Wall and the tallest. The series consists of the journey of Aegon from Egg to the King and of Duncan from Hedge Knight to Kingsguard.
Along with it various historical events of Westeros are expressed such as 'the Blackfyre Rebellion' that includes lot of Houses and a large cast of characters.
I recommend it to every GRRM fan.
