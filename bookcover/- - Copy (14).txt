Tuesdays with Morrie (1997)
by Mitch Albom

4/5

Review: "If you hold back on the emotions--if you don't allow yourself to go all the way through them--you can never get to being detached, you're too busy being afraid. You're afraid of the pain, you're afraid of the grief. You're afraid of the vulnerability that loving entails. But by throwing yourself into these emotions, by allowing yourself to dive in, all the way, over your heard even, you experience them fully and completely."

I usually don't read much self-help due to it's mainstreamness, phoniness ( okay, I'm being Holden Caulfield here, lol) and some are too capitalist... The reason I've read this is it's a biography and it was better than I expected.

Coming to philosophy, It's not much of a prophecy... It's something your grandparents advices usually advices you and that's fascinating in a way :D. The teacher - student relationship was very heart-warming and the book is overall very touchy in times.

I recommend the audiobook read by Mitch Albom himself as that recording contains a conversation between Mitch and Morrie only few days before Morrie passed away which is quite tear jearking.
