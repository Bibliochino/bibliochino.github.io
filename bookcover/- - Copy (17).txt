Persuasion (1818)
by Jane Austen

4/5

Review: "She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.” 

4.5 stars I guess..

A subtly subversive story of English literature. This was my first Jane Austen's read. It expresses the times of early-nineteenth-century perfectly without any extravagant drama.

I've only seen the adaptations of Austen's i.e. Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility and Love & Friendship which fascinated me greatly. I would say I enjoyed the initial chapters more than the ending as the other half was too savvy for me to understand and there were times I wasn't getting the plot so I had to take help from SparkNotes, although it was written so beautifully.

With the usual Austenian theme of marriage plots and happy endings, it describes the class system and gender relations with their firm protocols of behaviour sublimely. There's a lot of diversity of characters here. There are lots of things to learn for us in the acts of characters from that lost time.

Highly Recommended! I wish to read more of her works.
