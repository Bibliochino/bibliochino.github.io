The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (2003)
by Mark Haddon

1/5

Review: A total disappointment 
The concept of this book was utterly fascinating for me to start reading it, even the chapters framed in prime numbers was interesting and initiation was good but after few pages its so booooring... It is called a mystery novel but there's nothing mysterious about it even the case gets solved suddenly in the midst, there isn't a story here just some series of daily life events an autistic boy experiences and the whole book is roaming elsewhere off-topic. 

There are lots of unwanted figures and events, It's a total waste of time don't read it
