Jonathan Livingston Seagull (1970)
by Richard Bach

4/5

Review: “Overcome space, and all we have left is Here. Overcome time, and all we have left is Now.”

It's a beautiful fable with excellent photographs about seeking a higher purpose in life, thinking out of the box and getting one's sleeves up to start working on one's own idea of success which is as unique as a perspective ... And this man knows a lot about Seagulls haha!

It is a transcendentally inspiring simple short (can be easily completed in an hour) story.
