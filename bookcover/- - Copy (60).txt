The Martian (2014)
by Andy Weir

5/5

Review: An Extreme Sci-fi Techie Thriller 

Oh My Gauss!! It's so mindfreaking..
It's full of hardcore science stuffs but the great thing is it's so realistic.It's a great story of surviving in the Worst Case Scenario. Andy Weir's like exploited a hell of knowledge from lot of fields of science like physics,chemistry & botany.He's soo creative..

There's a lot of things to say about the main character Mark Watney like he's so humurous & sarcastic in all the odds.He is so god dammmit Intelligent that he manages all the stuffs despites all the adversities.He's got a real spirit of survival,it's so interesting to see how he makes the things work..

I've never read such pure science thrilling stuff before.I'm a lot excited for the movie directed by Ridley Scott & starring Matt Damon.
