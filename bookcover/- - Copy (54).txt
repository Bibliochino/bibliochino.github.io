Frankenstein (1818)
by Mary Shelley

4.5/5

Review: “Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. 
The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. 
Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.”

It's quite a great classic gothic horror written by Mary Shelley at the age of 18 only..wow!. It was very beautifully written..It's indeed a pioneer work in science fiction.
It defines an eternal bond between a creation and a creator, an existence which chooses his path and purpose.
The creature created by Frankenstein being so terrifying and horrific from outside has a very beautiful mind inside.
All the acts of the monster are consequences of finding hatred in search for love and compassion.
This story really explains the mind of an horrific monster driven by the miseries of his existence and beauty of the nature, that explains both the good and bad parts of any being.
Along this Mary raises questions in our minds like Should we create something only because we have skills and knowledge to do so?
what about it's ethical and philosophical implications??

Those were the things I could grasp from it... The ending was kinda disappointing. It's more misery than horror..
