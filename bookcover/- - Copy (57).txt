To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)
by Harper Lee

3/5

Review: 3.5 stars 
“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.”

'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a sweet family tale whose message rolls on human equality.Every human being deserves to be treated with dignity.
There are lots of different types of people in our environment and as a social being humans needs each other so they should respect everyone,
described in the tale as a metaphor - "Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird."
Boo Radley being a ridicule at the end proves to be real helpful and sweet just want to be left alone.

“I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.
- Atticus Finch”
The character of Atticus was best as a father and also in the society, his excellent ways of upbringing their children, always helpful to everyone and never being rude.
The story was pretty good but I felt it eloooongated so it was somewhat boooring, but alright Scout & Jem were quite adorable..
