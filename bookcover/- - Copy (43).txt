The Power (2009)
by Rhonda Byrne

2/5

Review: I don't regret the theme of this book ... but Mann! this so exaggerating, everyone knows all this things, it's insidious and we actually receive these things from our environment itself. The book was like' Yes, you can do it and blah blah' It's so boring. If anyone wants to try something like this go for 'The Secret'.
I would say the quotes of famous people in it are actually good but all that are not in the harmony with the topic in which the author describes them, it actually creates an illusion leading to misunderstand the actual meaning of them. 
Life is so short to read books like this
