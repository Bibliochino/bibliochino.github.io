Deception Point (2001)
by Dan Brown

4/5

Review : An excellent blend of Sci-fi & Politics 

It's been a very looong read..

Dan Brown is one of my favourite author & this was his third book I've read..Dan always targets some great figures or organisations in his every book which makes it sometimes controversial but very exciting.He is a man with a vast knowledge in the fields of Science, Geology, Religion and many others sometimes it just makes me wonder!!

The story was very thrilling it's got excellent twists till end. The Character of Rachel Sexton was very strong at centre.There was a lot of mind blowing techie stuffs & A house of cards among politicians.There were lots of terrific action scenes..

I think there was some middle part which felt somewhat empty but the last part was much fascinating & exciting.
