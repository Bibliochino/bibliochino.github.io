Review: Quite a thought on Existentialism.

My first thoughts are Rationalism which is explained deeper in 'The Critique of Pure Reason' by Immanuel Kant.

“Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”. 

A Theory can be predicted from this short story is that the world described as a school to become mature or spiritually wise and one won't pass out with bad grades. That's so perspective :D

Being a staunch supporter of Krishna consciousness and his theory of Karma, I believe that Krishna being the supreme personality of Godhead is a manifestation of Super Soul with which every individual soul is connected with certain divine 'nadis' in our body. So the almighty is a true lover, it has a feeling of love with every soul and thus everybody be it any type monster, diablo or a saintly person. So sending souls to 'Hell' is actually a great feeling of love because it is a place to eliminate all the evility and impureness in one and thus no soul is permanently in Inferno, it's there for a time being (It's just a thought! coz that surpasses the concept of time itself! ;) ).

Similarly souls reincarnate on Planets as bodies to repeat their courses to improve grades for the entry in Paradise.

So all the things happening to us are the Best to us. :)
