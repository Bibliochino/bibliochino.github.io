Room (2010)
by Emma Donoghue

5/5

Review: “When I tell her what I’m thinking and she tells me what she’s thinking, our each ideas jumping into the other’s head, like colouring blue crayon on top of yellow that makes green.”

This review is for the audiobook because I think its more interesting to hear it from an 5-year old and all the emotions are actually felt more deeper.

A very warm and touching tale of unbounded mother-son love. With a 5-year old boy as the protagonist, the whole story is told in his own perspective. I have also seen the adaptation which is excellent but the book is great.

Inside the Room, Ma has created a whole universe for Jack, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life.

I suppose the most fascinating thing about it was the story altough being dark is described quite humourously by the boy. It is a tale of redemption from confinement in a Count of Monte Cristo style and then the struggle to face the big real world after being in solitude for such a long time like Plato's allegory of the cave.

Alas, it's powerful message that a mother's love is so important for a child than any other thngs in the whole universe.
