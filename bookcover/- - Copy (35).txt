The Prophet (1923)
by Kahlil Gibran

5/5

Review:“We wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us. Even while the earth sleeps we travel. We are the seeds of the tenacious plant, and it is in our ripeness and our fullness of heart that we are given to the wind and are scattered.”

When I started reading this book, I was so malicious to catch every single flaw in it ...
But I found None! It is a perfect piece of literature and a great beauty in itself.
The Philosophical Poetry is so Sublime! with delightful metaphors.
I can't actually quote any favourite part from it, I am speechless and I would love to read it again.
Highly Recommended!
