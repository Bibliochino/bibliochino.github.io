The Bed Of Procrustes: Philosophical And Practical Aphorisms (2010)
by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

4/5

Review: This was a book having a Postface instead of a Preface.. A beautiful book full of Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms.
The story of 'The Bed of Procrustes' (a Greek myth) is metaphorized in every aphorism in this book.

We humans, facing limits of knowledge, and things do not observe, the unseen and the unknown, resolve the tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp commoditized ideas, reductive categories, specific vocabularies, and prepackaged narratives, which, on the occasion, has explosive consequences.
Our minds are not good at handling non-anecdotal and tend to be swayed by vivid imagery, making the media distort our view of the world.

The book was different and great as the Aphorisms are one of the earliest literary forms, there were various various philosophies of Taleb's own and various others so there was some controversial parts.. but it's OK.
I recommend it.
