The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890)
by Oscar Wilde

5/5

Review:	How sad it is! I shall grow old and horrible and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June... If it were I who was to be always young and the picture that was to grow old! For that I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that! 

This is a magnificent piece of English literature. It's Sublime! Beautifully written deep story with memorable characters.
It describes shallowness, cruelty, selfishness and vanity beautifully. The dialogues and prose were delivered excellently by Oscar Wilde.
The initial part i.e. like 1/3rd was quite humourous and the rest a Gothic Horror! and existential philosophy.
Despite the dark, it's very compelling. The book has a great reflection and an association with Art! and that is painting.
A painting symbolically described as the imagery of Dorian Gray's vices hiding the ugliness behind the mask of eternal youth.
It is a tale of enthrallment in corruption under the influence of an extreme hedonist (Lord Henry Wotton).
Alas, It is a deeply moving story of inhuman callous (but not a monster) and it's consequences ...

It's my FAVOURITE ... RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!
