The Girl on the Train (2015)
by Paula Hawkins

5/5

Review: “A tiding of magpies: One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told”

Such a mind blowing...Each scene gave me chills in the pit of my stomach..It was at some extent a psychological thriller too..The story was quite awesome.There was so much suspence in every scene & the set up was all great.I was so hooked up till the end.I think it could have a still better ending...but although I can't rate it less than 5 it was a hell lot interesting.The Flow with all the characters was fascinating..
