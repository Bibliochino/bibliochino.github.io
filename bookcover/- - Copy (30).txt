Lord of the Flies (1954)
by William Golding

5/5

Review: “His voice rose under the black smoke before the burning wreckage of the island; and infected by that emotion, the other little boys began to shake and sob too. And in the middle of them, with filthy body, matted hair, and unwiped nose, Ralph wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart, and the fall through the air of the true." 

Maybe there is a beast… maybe it's only us. 

I've got the conch now, so listen up! 

This book is so horrifying, scared the hell outta me. This is one of the rare masterpieces on Earth. I declare 'Lord of the Flies' and '1984' as my most favourite book of all time. Lord of the Flies is an allegory to human savagery in civilisation, it symbolizes the violent and savage human nature. The best part of the book is that it is very ambiguous it has lots of interpretations in terms of philosophy, history, religion, psychological and political aspects. Though written in a very pessimist and horrifying theme it is truly an 'eye-opener' and a 'demanded reading'. It is so thought provoking for children that explains the circumstantial transformation of ones good self into evil. This also describes how an entire system corrupts due to sanguineness of few people.

William Golding has excellence in creating such a horrid theme on a beautiful place in a philosophically Dystopian novel. The characters are perfectly made each having its own distinguishing traits that signifies primitivity, innocence, order, fear, power, identity, wisdom and youth.
My favourite characters were Simon and Piggy. The story is magnificent with terrifying scenes and twists.

Been a hooker for me. A one of the best literary piece, recommendations to everyone. 5 stars not just enough ...
