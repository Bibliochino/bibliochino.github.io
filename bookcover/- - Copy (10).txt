Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2001)
by Newt Scamander

1/5

Review: Just a classification of various beasts inspired from several mythologies. Totally avoidable. No original base, completely dependent on HP series. Waste of time - except for * Yes, I remember this creature from HP Series *.
Go watch Planet Earth instead, you'll find how real life animals can be far more fascinating
