The Alchemist (1988)
by Paulo Coelho

4/5

Review: Every search begins with beginner's luck and every search ends with the victor's being severly tested.No one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun.All you have to do is contemplate a simple grain of sand,and you will see in all the marvels of creation.
