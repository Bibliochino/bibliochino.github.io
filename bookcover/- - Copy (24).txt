Will Grayson, Will Grayson (2010)
by John Green

4/5

Review:	“You like someone who can't like you back because unrequited love can be survived in a way that once-requited love cannot. ” 

This book is incredibly humourous, gay and touching as well. It's written by two authors with alternative chapters by each of them ... each playing their own Will Grayson in the first person, so it's like a double benefit to read it from two quite different perspectives!

There is this grumpy 'Will Grayson' of John who tries to ignore people and shuts his mouth and this depressed 'will grayson' of David who turns out to be gay (his entire part is written in lowercase which pretty much symbolizing him) ... I think I liked JG's 'Will Grayson' more due to his Schrodinger's Cat analogy (Wow!) and I am like him in many ways. The other 'will grayson' was kinda dark and very reluctant! and one day they met each other, this event leads to change their lives in many ways in many ways :)

I enjoyed it, was quite a funny read (Tiny Copper XD) ... but the ending was kinda okay for me, although I admire this book due to its simplicity and not adding excessive useless drama here.

Recommended! :D
