The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902)
by Arthur Conan Doyle

4/5

Review:	4.5 stars 
This is the first Sherlock Holmes book I've read and it's so beautifully written.
I would call it a Victorian horror with pretty plot twists.
Sherlock is pretty much sophisticated character as I had expected, and will be my all-time favourite detective.
The most fascinating parts of the books were the scenes that took place at night in Dartmoor and Grimpen Mire also it's very suspenseful till end ..
The whole setting was amazing and nocturnal.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing style is so splendid that I'm excited to read next books of him.
