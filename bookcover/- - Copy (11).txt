A Study in Scarlet (1887)
by Arthur Conan Doyle

4/5

Review: “There's the Scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.” 

A great introduction to the most famous literary character 'Sherlock Holmes' that has been adapted the most in screens and other works in literature unlike anyone, along with his partner 'Dr. John Watson'. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing is undoubtedly sublime and the most special feature of 'A Study in Scarlet' is all the humanitarian quotes.

There was lot of suspense in the story as expected but the surprising part was it's transition to a Western as a part of the criminal's history, there were lots of historical significance i.e. reign of Mormons, the Birmingham Young, dangers of organised religion and hypocrisy in it.

The theme consists of Modernism at that time, the advancement of technological use on criminal science and Doyle's invention of 'the Science of Deduction' in his works was even followed for the development of criminology.

I now want even more of Sherlock Holmes and thus: Next => The Sign of Four [Sherlock Holmes #2]...
