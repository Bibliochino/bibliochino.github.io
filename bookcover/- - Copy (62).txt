The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians #1) (2005)
by Rick Riordan

3/5

Review: 3.5 stars

This was my first Rick Riordan's & I enjoyed his simple & lucid style. The story was fantastic, thrilling & also humuorous modern mythical Greek fantasy.I loved the character of Percy like always so impulsive & brave, also the characters of Annabeth & Grover were good..

The all set up was great of the mythical Greek gods,demigods,godlings & monsters action scenes were quite good.

The thing that disappointed me was that I was expecting the scene of the poster i.e. a great fight of Percy using the Lightening bolt in the Sea over a horrible enemy & creation of potential infront of a great city expect that other things were cool.It just lacked a somewhat dreadful.

But okay...
overall nice..
