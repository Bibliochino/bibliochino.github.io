The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed & Lorraine Warren (2002)
by Gerald Brittle

4/5

Review: You can't kill something that's existed since the beginning of time whose watchword is anonymity.

The Warrens are the couples who solved the famous cases of - The Conjuring, The Amityville, Annabelle and much more as Ed being The Demonologist and Lorraine the Clairvoyant...

I had heard much about Ed as being the only civil demonologist in America, who had solved a lot of cases of inhuman possessions and other terrific paranormal activities. This book like a must read thing to understand all the things in a horror movie or to get a lot of knowledge about human spirits, demons or devils.

This was a True Demonology. After reading this I saw 'The Exorcist' movie and I am like to understand every scene of it!

I have a strong belief in God as well as Devilic Legions and I think it's a must read to everyone as to understand anyone around possessed by any demonic forces and to find a solution fast before it's too late..
