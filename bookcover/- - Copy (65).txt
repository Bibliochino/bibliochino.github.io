The Importance of Being Earnest (1895)
by Oscar Wilde

5/5

Review: A classical play by Oscar Wilde with best dialogues ever.There's a lot of fascinating vocabulary used which makes it an essence of English literature.The play is quite humourous & dramatic,a family play about relationships.I loved the style of writing & characters were great.The play was just great I don't have words to express..
