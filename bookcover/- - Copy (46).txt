Night (1958)
by Elie Wiesel

5/5

Review:	Night is a heartbreaking unnerving account by Eliezor as a teenager, who survived horrific concentration camps like Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Birkenau and Buna. This intense and terribly realistic narration is a painful son-father tale about fear, hatred, religion and humanity. Wiesel's description of every thought and apathetic attitude pushes the reader from his role of an observer to an active participant.
After reading this I just wanna say 'I love my mom's handmade soup!' :)
I recommend this to everyone as to forget the sacrificed would be akin to killing them a second time.
