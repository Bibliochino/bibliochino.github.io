The Science of Interstellar (2014)
by Kip S. Thorne

5/5

Review: Interstellar is one my fav film & Christopher Nolan is my fav director I have seen all movies of him (except 'following' which I m gonna watch soon) besides him the work of 'double negative' the visual effect team of Paul Franklin made to Oscar & ofcourse the sources Kip Throne & Lynda Obst...

The Climax of the film 'The Tesserect' made me surprisingly awestrucked which happens to arise my interest in the book of the great scientist Kip Throne..

The chapters in the book are labeled as-
1) Truth
2) Educated Guess
3) Speculation
So it's a complete interpretation of scientific phenomenons happening in the movie from that I have known things that I had never heard before...

The most interesting parts of book are:
# The 5D Bulk
# The Brands
# Gravitational Anomalies
# Warped Space-Time
# Tidal Gravity
# Black Holes (Gargantua)
# Worm Holes
# Gravitational Slingshots
# Blight (On Earth)
# Miller's & Mann's Planets
# The Tesserect
These are the mind blowing concepts scientists have discovered recently..

I would write a lot about Tesserect, Black holes & Wormholes but I don't want spoilers here...lol there isn't anything like spoilers in science non-fiction u will have to read it to get it...

The thing I wanna say is we humans r capable of discovering, deciphering, mastering and using to control our own fate & of dealing with most any catastrophe the universe may throw at us or our own ones..

We are very close to discover the unified theory to unravel all the mysteries of forces & fields in nature by amalgamation of Newtonian,Relativistic,Quantum & other new laws.We come across new frontiers no matter how incognita it seems.
